Approach:
I built the app using functional React Native components with forms to register users and products.
 All data is stored in local state using React hooks (useState, useEffect). I styled the app with NativeWind for a consistent look and applied basic validation to both user and product forms. 
 To keep the process simple, I also added useful features like editing users and products to make the system more user-friendly and appropriate.

Trade-offs:

✓ PROS:

Zero setup required, works immediately

No network dependency (fully offline)

Simple API, easy to understand and maintain

No server costs or infrastructure needed

Data privacy: all data stays on the device

✗ CONS:

Performance degrades with large datasets (array operations in local state)

No advanced querying capabilities (must load all data to filter or search)

No data relationships or foreign keys

Limited scalability (not ideal for thousands of records)

Risk of data loss if app is uninstalled or reset

No synchronization between devices

Manual transaction logging increases complexity
